# MolGen.pyp (Generated by Copilot)

## Description
MolGen.pyp is a Python script that generates molecular structures based on user-defined rules and parameters. It utilizes a combination of algorithms and data structures to create diverse and realistic molecules.

## Features
- Rule-based generation: Define rules for atom types, bond types, and molecular properties to guide the generation process.
- Customizable parameters: Adjust various parameters such as molecule size, bond length, and atom properties to control the output.
- Output formats: Export generated molecules in popular file formats such as PDB, SDF, or SMILES.
- Visualization: Visualize the generated molecules using integrated 3D rendering capabilities.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the "MolGen.pyp" script.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the "MolGen.pyp" script.
2. Run the script using the following command:
    ```
    python MolGen.pyp
    ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to specify the generation rules and parameters.
4. Once the generation is complete, the generated molecules will be saved in the specified output format.

## Examples
Here are a few examples of how to use the script:

- Generate a small molecule with default parameters:
  ```
  python MolGen.pyp --size small
  ```

- Generate a large molecule with custom rules:
  ```
  python MolGen.pyp --size large --rules rules.json
  ```

- Generate a molecule and save it in PDB format:
  ```
  python MolGen.pyp --format pdb
  ```
